Note: AC is the amount that the chance to hit is reduced by. So if it is 10, then it is reduced by 0%. Every AC down from there is 3% more reduced per AC down.
9 would be a 3% reduction of chance to hit.
Note: Treasure means the chance that the monster is carrying treasure (item or gold) on it when it is killed.
