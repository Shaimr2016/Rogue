- wanderMovement should have a chance to move away even when isNextTo(Player)
- base armor needs to be 10
- Wand names
- I found a null LoL
- When "found a" make it be a or an based on first letter of getName()
- First input is bugged and updates map but not player
- Scrolls don't always have the same name for the same type
- Get hungry too fast
- Rings don't hide their names
- Need to update stealing attacks so that the item one keeps the item and drops it as treasure, and stealgold drops gold one as treasure.
- Both stealGold and stealItem attackTypes need to have the monster run away from player (or tp away) after it steals from player
- Doors can generate next to each other
- Monsters can spawn in the same place as an item, causing the item to look like it is there for one turn, and then be overwritten on the first
map update by the monster
