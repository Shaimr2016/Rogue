BUGS:
- Scrolls don't always have the same name for the same type
- Both stealGold and stealItem attackTypes need to have the monster run away from player (or tp away) after it steals from player
- stealItem has some bugs with it, but is mostly functional - stealItem should be changed so it only takes certain (magical) items
- Staircase remains in level even when you change levels
- One of the wands causes a monster duplication glitch
- The last loaded row of the table doesnâ€™t show (only in JAR form)
- Button text in BeginPane doesn't appear on Mac
- When you put on a ring it says "held", when it should say "worn"
- When monsters drop an item somewhere other than where they are, after picking up, it looks like there is a monster there.


Features To Implement:
- MAKE SURE TO TEST BLINDNESS
- three ring powers
- several wand powers (see animations)
- one scroll type
- change armor to be about damage reduction
- throwing items
- different food potencies
- monster and item spawnChances
- make settings save to a file in data folder, so that settings are saved on exit of game.
- runType movementType would be good, especially for monsters that steal items, becuase then they should run from the player
- traps!!!! Make them spawn, even though they have already technically been implemented.
- on quit, game should reopen BeginPane.
- Make background of BeginPane and SettingsPane
- Maybe, and this could be difficult, have the load panel show images of the games that were taken right before they were saved
    Essentially, when saving, take a screenshot of the game (somehow) and then keep it with the save, and display it in the
    loading panel
- Lower damage done by mace
- Items should on use reveal their hidden names
- When using an item, everything should update.

ALPHA TESTER SUGGESTIONS:
- kobold attack too high
- two many secret doorways
- make snake less health

Plausible future changes:
    Saving and loading!?!?!
    Amulet of Yendor maybe?
    Make the game easier to download and use
    Settings:
        Changeable symbols (walls, floors, player) - cannot be the same as a monster symbol.
        Changeable colors? - monsters, items, player.
        hunger/difficulty - like in Minecraft; easy, normal, hard
    Inventory stacking - if you have two food items of the same type, just make the name "[food] (x2)"
    Add shop? a button you click to buy things using gold.


DAD'S NOTES (USELESS, IGNORE (JK))
- Starting pack should include: food, bow, arrows (random number) short sword (+1, +1),  ring mail (+1)
