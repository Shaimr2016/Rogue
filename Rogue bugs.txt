BUGS:
- Scrolls don't always have the same name for the same type
- Both stealGold and stealItem attackTypes need to have the monster run away from player (or tp away) after it steals from player
- Monsters can spawn in the same place as an item, causing the item to look like it is there for one turn, and then be overwritten on the first
map update by the monster
- Leprechauns can take more gold than you have... you end up with negative gold...
- When a monster dies standing on top of an item, if it drops an item, the item is just removed from existence...
- Throw button is smaller than the other buttons
- stealItem has some bugs with it, but is mostly functional - stealItem should be changed so it only takes certain (magical) items
- Ascending Staircase is not functional... Check out what is wrong with it.
- Staircase remains in level even when you change levels
- One of the wands causes a monster duplication glitch
- The last loaded row of the table doesnâ€™t show (only in JAR form)


Features To Implement:
- MAKE SURE TO TEST BLINDNESS
- three ring powers
- several wand powers (see animations)
- one scroll type
- change armor to be about damage reduction
- throwing items
- different food potencies
- monster and item spawnChances
- make settings save to a file in data folder, so that settings are saved on exit of game.
- runType movementType would be good, especially for monsters that steal items, becuase then they should run from the player
- traps!!!! Make them spawn, even though they have already technically been implemented.
- on close, SettingsPane should reopen BeginPane.

ALPHA TESTER SUGGESTIONS:
- kobold attack too high
- two many secret doorways
- make snake less health

Plausible future changes:
    Saving and loading!?!?!
    Amulet of Yendor maybe?
    Make the game easier to download and use
    Scrolling inventory!?!?!???!
    Settings:
        Changeable keys
        Changeable symbols (walls, floors, player) - cannot be the same as a monster symbol.
        Changeable colors? - monsters, items, player.
        hunger/difficulty - like in Minecraft; easy, normal, hard
    Inventory stacking - if you have two food items of the same type, just make the name "[food] (x2)"
    Add shop? a button you click to buy things using gold.


DAD'S NOTES (USELESS, IGNORE (JK))
- Starting pack should include: food, bow, arrows (random number) short sword (+1, +1),  ring mail (+1)
